If the magnetic field is not perpendicular to the object, then use the calculator below, which computes the magnetic flux at non-perpendicular angles. The magnetic flux is directly proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic field emanating from the object and the area of the object. The greater the magnetic field, the greater the magnetic flux. Conversely, the smaller the magnetic field, the smaller the flux. The area of the object has the same direct relationship. The greater the area of an object, the greater the flux. Conversely, the smaller the area, the smaller the magnetic flux."}}}
